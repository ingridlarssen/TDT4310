 Instead of rallying the scientific community, instead of educating the American people about the need for social distancing and the other things that we have to do, Trump's inaction has cost the lives of many, many Americans. This is a crisis. People don't know how they're going to afford to stay in their homes. We need to suspend rent and mortgage payments, evictions, and foreclosures nationwide. I support workers who strike, conduct a sick-out, or participate in a walk-off to support our collective health and safety amid this pandemic. Period. A Medicare for All system is designed to provide quality care to all — not simply make huge amounts of money for insurance and drug companies. https://t.co/CqjwTzqssc if you’re a student, join our call tonight!!! in support of @BernieSanders LETS DO THIS!!! https://t.co/JtVyjamjMC BREAKING: We are PROUD to add the Movement for Black Lives (@Mvmnt4BlkLives) to our list of 
#Covid19 frontline organizations that we are supporting.

Black people were in crisis before this pandemic.

@BernieSanders #Bernie2020 https://t.co/3FW7FjvN2L The cruelty and absurdity of our for-profit health care system is more obvious in the midst of this crisis than it has ever been. The American people want Medicare for All. https://t.co/cgsW1x8s8M During this growing economic crisis, tens of millions of Americans are on the verge of going hungry. We cannot allow that to happen. The federal government must act now to make sure that every American has access to the food they need during this horrific pandemic. We cannot continue to have a dysfunctional, greedy health care system which ties most people's health care coverage to employment, leaves tens of millions uninsured and bankrupts over 500,000 people a year.

We must guarantee health care as a human right through Medicare for All. Under Medicare for All, rural hospitals would finally have consistent funding rather than being forced into closure based on the business models of profit-seeking health insurers. The Federal Reserve estimates that upwards of 47 million people could lose their jobs.
 
That means tens of millions losing insurance in addition to the 30 million already uninsured.
 
Under Medicare for All, no one would lose their health insurance if they lost their job. While there is no simple health care fix to the destruction of coronavirus, under a Medicare for All system, everyone would have comprehensive health care free at the point of service. No one would avoid going to the doctor due to cost, or go into debt just for getting sick. We must never forget that we are only as healthy as the least insured among us. When one of us gets sick, all of us have the potential to get sick. When our neighbor loses their job, that hurts our community and local economy. The coronavirus pandemic is highlighting every day the many ways in which our country leaves the poor and vulnerable behind.

Millions of workers have no paid leave.

Half our people live paycheck to paycheck.
 
And 87 million are uninsured or underinsured. People shouldn't have to put their lives on the line to vote. Wisconsin should join the 15 states delaying elections, delay Tuesday’s vote, extend early voting, and work to send every voter a ballot by mail. While we wait for a decision we urge our supporters to vote-by-mail. Rent is due tomorrow. #COVID19 is causing a housing crisis – but truth is, the US housing system has been in crisis for a long time.

We need #RentZero for today, and a #HomesGuarantee for the future.

Join our next organizing call: https://t.co/jh5Y3PagdP https://t.co/NzQVaXbe9i Walmart is owned by the wealthiest family in the country.

Yet workers say they do not have the protective gear they need; very few have paid leave they can use; and many are making low wages.

Will you join me in calling on Walmart to protect its workers?https://t.co/LhiJEk1npP It's disgraceful that Amazon, which is owned by the richest man in the world, is not only failing to protect its workers but has now fired a worker for protesting dangerous conditions. I stand with Chris and all Amazon workers fighting for their safety. https://t.co/CRm750EvK3 Transgender people everywhere deserve to live in dignity and security. Together, we will end hatred and bigotry towards trans Americans and build a nation based on love, justice and civil rights. #TransDayOfVisibility Far too many women in America have inadequate wages that leave them struggling to get by. Expanding workers' rights and raising wages means we must finally end the pay gap. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/4L0ySu4yac Americans deserve better than a health care system where  people are terrified and need treatment, but are afraid to go to the doctor or emergency room because they cannot afford the bill. They deserve Medicare for All. The #GenderPayGap leads to a lifetime of inequality between men &amp; women. As the Coronavirus pandemic reveals the depths of our nation's inequity, on #EqualPayDay we must strive for bold, comprehensive policies - e.g. a living wage, unv. childcare - to create a more just society. https://t.co/ZvurNiMBZU We must construct emergency shelters and utilize vacant lodging to provide survivors of domestic violence the shelter, the health care and the nutrition they need, and to connect those individuals with social services to ensure nobody is left behind. https://t.co/DER7G1VvzB Tune in for a very special livestream forum with my friend and colleague @BernieSanders, Dr. @CornelWest, and @soniashah.

Livestream available at https://t.co/ZzDMTOYVPx https://t.co/EzYr3yxayD Virtual town hall  @BernieSanders with @CornelWest and others at 7 regarding coronavirus. What questions do you have for our panel tonight?

Tune in soon at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/ISfqxGWVIV We must move forward on a fourth coronavirus stimulus package.

This bill must protect workers, not hand out more corporate welfare. 

It must provide a full paycheck for laid off workers for the duration of the crisis, and guarantee health care for all. Join me tonight at 7pm ET for a livestream on the coronavirus pandemic with @BernieSanders, Dr. @CornelWest, Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), and Sonia Shah. https://t.co/AYPUFxA77l https://t.co/NEm4PQRXYD Tonight at 7 p.m. ET, join our livestream on the coronavirus pandemic with guests Dr. @CornelWest, Rep. @DeFazio4Oregon, @RevDrBarber, and @soniashah, featuring music from @NRateliff.

Join at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/M44Hcmcl2B We must make sure that the checks from the first stimulus package get to people as quickly as possible. Next, we must build a new stimulus package to go even further. https://t.co/trIUxCtIuy Corporations like Whole Foods have a moral obligation to take this pandemic seriously and stop putting profits over people. Add your name to stand with Whole Foods workers who are demanding an immediate expansion of paid sick hours for all employees: https://t.co/bwuwywrJIi Tonight, @SethMeyers has a remote interview with @BernieSanders! Plus, #ACloserLook at the current state of the #Covid_19 pandemic. https://t.co/R4X61j4WS1 We are dealing with an unprecedented pandemic and economic crisis. Please take a moment to upload a video of yourself and tell us how the coronavirus is affecting you. Your story may be featured on our website and official social media channels: https://t.co/iBXMqOVxRR https://t.co/hCVvicqCrH Jeff Bezos is the wealthiest person in the world. Amazon pays $0 in federal income taxes. Yet Bezos refuses to protect Amazon warehouse workers. I stand with the workers today demanding safe working conditions and paid leave. https://t.co/TwJUPzdIlN Our health care system should be about protecting lives, not making huge profits for corporations. We are facing estimates of over 100,000 coronavirus deaths. It is outrageous that a Philadelphia real estate investor who closed a hospital is now trying to gouge the city to re-open it. @HelenGymPHL is right: the city should reopen Hahnemann hospital immediately. https://t.co/V08gYcxxfq There is something very, very wrong when we spend twice as much per capita on health care as other major countries, yet tens of millions are uninsured and we have worse health outcomes.

The profit-driven health care system has got to change.

We need Medicare for All. Jane and I are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of State Rep. Isaac Robinson. He served as a vice chair for our campaign in Michigan and believed strongly in a fairer future for all. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. https://t.co/uW6xw6YylA Anti-Semitism and Nazism destroyed a good part of my family. I’ll fight to make sure hatred has no place in our country. https://t.co/SbfxEvddD0 It is unacceptable that tens of millions of Americans, despite working hard at full-time jobs, now find themselves laid off, with nothing in the bank and are terrified as to how they'll be able to feed their kids. Our current economy, which allows for a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality and forces half of our people to live paycheck-to-paycheck, must be replaced by an economy that works for all, not just the few. There is no excuse for the wealthiest nation on Earth not to be prepared to have adequate test kits for a pandemic, or have the protective masks, gloves and gowns our medical personnel require. Our dysfunctional health care system must be replaced by a Medicare for All, single-payer system, which not only guarantees health care for everyone as a right, but has a strong public health component which prepares our country for health care crises like the coronavirus. Now is the time. 

The unprecedented crises we are living in call for an unprecedented response. 

If there is any silver lining in the horrific situation we now find ourselves in, it is the need to understand how we got here and how we can prevent future disasters like this. It is simply absurd that massive corporations who make billions in profits every year claim they cannot afford to guarantee paid sick leave to their workers. If our medical personnel go down, who will treat the American people? Mr. Trump: Utilize the Defense Production Act and protect our medical personnel. https://t.co/xh5gpuxidB Corporate-run health insurance isn't about saving lives. It's about making as much money as possible. With Medicare for All we can finally put an end to this international disgrace. https://t.co/sZrb6FcUPz We need a clean Carcieri fix to reaffirm the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for all federally recognized Indian tribes. A Sanders administration will prioritize that. We must reset the partnership between the federal government and Tribal Nations by putting land – and control of that land – back in the hands of tribes. For far too long, the federal government has adopted policies that take land away from tribes, ignore treaty rights and interfere with tribal management of their own resources. I stand with the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe in their fight to restore lands that belong to them, and I oppose the disgraceful decision by the Trump Administration to disestablish their lands held in trust by the Department of Interior. https://t.co/pNH2YUH00D Using this health and economic crisis to union bust is morally unacceptable. I’m calling on @Everlane to bring workers back on payroll and recognize the @EverlaneU. https://t.co/5AC2cMhwzw .@Instacart was last valued at nearly $8 billion. A company of this size should not be forcing its workers to put themselves — and us all — at risk. I stand with the workers, and encourage Instacart to meet the their demands.
https://t.co/x7Jid1NvWH Rev. Joseph Lowery was a titan of civil rights. He leaves behind an incredible legacy of fighting for justice that we must carry forward every day. Our thoughts are with the Lowery family. https://t.co/bDCLsV2b40 Along with pausing mortgage payments, evictions, and utility shutoffs, we must place a moratorium on rent payments, especially in states hardest-hit by the coronavirus like New York. We must build on the important work @sengianaris and others are doing to make this happen. https://t.co/FKDbZYk4Pp People today are dying, knowing they're sick, but they're not going to the hospital because they can't afford the bill that they'll be picking up.

That is an international disgrace.

We need to make health care a right. This is absolutely barbaric. The cruelty and absurdity of our for-profit health care system is more obvious in the midst of this crisis than it has ever been. We need Medicare for All. https://t.co/jUsEA1Lp5M In this crisis we must listen to the experts and do everything we can to protect our medical personnel who are on the front lines. Join our livestream with doctors and nurses on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic: https://t.co/Av9K7DrAJG Tonight I will be hosting a livestream with doctors and nurses on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. Tune in at 7 p.m. ET at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/ovUnQaRj9k Right now, the phone lines of unemployment offices around the country are jammed and websites are crashing. The federal government must immediately put together the necessary staffing and technology to address the unprecedented number of requests for help that are coming in. This is a crisis.

The stimulus package just passed can provide real help to millions, but it won’t matter unless the federal bureaucracy is able to implement the program and get the money out.

No business as usual. People need help NOW, not in several months. Losing your job and being unemployed is difficult enough. You shouldn’t lose your health insurance too. Medicare for All means always being covered. The fact that we are the only major country not to guarantee paid leave, and millions of workers cannot take paid sick days, is a public health emergency. "We have to make sure where we're working at is safe. I'm scared...When it comes to @Amazon, there is so much more they could be doing for their employees."—Sahro Sharif, Amazon worker @AwoodMpls #WeAreAthena #COVID19 https://t.co/66KVvMoUS1 We need to listen to the experts to get through this crisis. https://t.co/PrLaIlelhc Last night's bill included the largest expansion of unemployment benefits in history. We will still need to go much further to help the working people of this country. https://t.co/ZQErjMJszD We have a president who is speaking in opposition to medical advisors in our own government. To me, this is as dangerous as he gets. https://t.co/fre8dKeLO4 I am grateful to receive the support of @WisMuslimVoters who promote civic participation among the Muslim community in Wisconsin. Now more than ever we must all come together so that every community gets the care and protection they need. https://t.co/K8QrmkzGsI Workers who are providing essential public services deserve hazard pay and adequate safety equipment. I applaud the members of @teamsters Local 249 who are standing up not just for themselves, but for workers everywhere. https://t.co/3qqgnLDuzD The coronavirus is spreading quickly, and the reality is that CVS workers are among some of those at the highest risk and are less likely to have paid sick leave.

Add your name to this petition to demand CVS provide a safe workplace for workers: https://t.co/VNCBzINwJa RT if you agree that we needed #MedicareForAll yesterday. Medicare for All means never losing your health insurance if you lose your job. That is what we must guarantee to the American people. It is unacceptable that healthcare workers are being forced to treat COVID-19 patients without personal protective equipment (PPE). Donald Trump must immediately invoke the Defense Production Act so that we can speed up the production of PPE for workers. https://t.co/Nfg02hYr1l We must move forward in terms of economic, social, racial and environmental justice, guarantee human rights and end this unfettered capitalism. https://t.co/3iykj3womb The coronavirus relief package must help working people, not large corporations. Join me for the latest update as Congress debates emergency legislation. https://t.co/8e7ckjEEms I'm joining Amazon workers to demand:

✅Paid sick leave for ALL
✅1.5x hazard pay
✅Childcare pay and subsidies
✅Stop enforcement of rate-based quotas
✅Closing of workplaces where employees test positive for coronavirus

📺 On your local @PBS station: https://t.co/o66B9J022g https://t.co/Yk9qIAGo91 It is outrageous that right-wing politicians in states like Texas and Ohio are using this crisis to risk women's health and safety by denying their right to abortion and other reproductive health care. Instead, we should be expanding access with things like telemedicine. Trump must use the Defense Production Act to produce hundreds of millions of the protective equipment we need. As our health care workers are protected, we must also focus on all workers at risk, including @TWULocal100 members exposed every day: https://t.co/MkcU8SFlMq In a dark time, this is very good news. Congratulations to Colorado on this important step toward justice. We must abolish the death penalty nationwide. https://t.co/tRwXa4bTLZ I do not think you only have a right to health care if you have the money to afford it. I think you have a right to health care because you are a human being. We cannot just give corporations money to do anything they want. We have to ensure that money is going to protect working people. https://t.co/hi8Os4ccvj In this unprecedented health and economic crisis, we must all stand together. Thank you to unions like @GoIUPAT who are rightly demanding proposals to make sure working people don’t lose their income and that everyone has all the health care they need. https://t.co/fzjNh12256 .@BernieSanders on the coronavirus response:

“Our job is to act in an unprecedented way, both in terms of healthcare and the economy. And it is going to cost a lot of money, but not spending that money now will make a bad situation even worse.” https://t.co/MWIhIMoGDm This is an unprecedented moment and we have got to think in an unprecedented way. Together, with the leadership of people like @AOC, @IlhanMN and @RashidaTlaib, we will get through this. https://t.co/L8xRdATjfA Thank you Jamar, Ethan, James and Phillip. Thank you to the millions of workers on the front lines of this pandemic. We owe you so much. We must do everything in our power to ensure the safety, security and respect for workers and their unions. https://t.co/YMVVBMD3Is We not only need to put a moratorium on utility shut-offs across the country. We must restore utility services to anyone who has had their utilities shut off. .@BernieSanders wins Democrats Abroad primary (180 countries) in highest turnout in history. "Our voters believe in affordable healthcare &amp; education, &amp; a government that looks after its people, both those citizens at home and abroad," https://t.co/3Eg1Hwen2M We must suspend rent and mortgage payments, evictions, and foreclosures across the country. We cannot abandon our people and allow families to be thrown out of their homes during a pandemic. https://t.co/TkAbdwz9ie We need an unprecedented legislative response that focuses on the emergency health care needs of the American people — not billions of dollars in corporate welfare to benefit CEOs and wealthy stockholders. Some of my Republican colleagues are calling for a $1,000, one-time check to Americans.

Really?

That'll last you two or three weeks. What happens after that?

We need to give every person in this country $2,000 a month for the duration of this crisis. we’re live!

To McDonald's and other massive corporations: Stop hoarding wealth for your executives and putting lives in danger.

Guarantee paid sick leave now. https://t.co/XCci1x54q6 We will get through this crisis by supporting each other and the most vulnerable. We identified new, important charities doing essential work during the pandemic. Can you add a contribution to support them? https://t.co/qJs9L2dLFN We cannot give Trump’s Treasury Department a blank check to bail out the airlines, cruise ships, hotels, and many other industries, while providing next to nothing to help the homeless or the most vulnerable people in this country. 6/6 Corporate pork producers are using the coronavirus to push Congress to expedite guest worker visas, even at a time when international travel and immigration is largely shut down. 5/6 Adidas wants to sneak in a long-sought provision allowing people to use pretax money to pay for gym memberships and fitness equipment — even when many gyms and retail stores are closed nationwide. 4/6 The National Association of Manufacturers wants $1.4 trillion, and the International Council of Shopping Centers wants a guarantee of up to $1 trillion. 3/6 The airline industry is asking for $50 billion, the private space industry is asking for $5 billion, and the hotel industry wants $150 billion. 2/6 Now is not the time to allow large corporations to take advantage of this horrific crisis by profiteering and ripping off U.S. taxpayers.

In the last few days, we’ve seen numerous examples of lobbyists and their agents fighting for special favors.

Here are a few of them. 1/6 We need to bail out workers, not corporations. https://t.co/MB5CEPmbsY Mr. President, get your act together. Utilize the Defense Production Act and protect our medical personnel. https://t.co/ozuT72PYQN I am grateful to receive the support of @PSC_CUNY and their 30,000 members, who are working tirelessly for the safety of their campuses and community throughout this pandemic. https://t.co/u2vhMInXWe In this extraordinary moment in American and world history, we have got to think outside the box in a way that we have never done. https://t.co/6NJJlOoEYr Trump must act now.

Not only are the lives of the heroes and heroines providing medical care on the line, the lives of millions across the rest of the country are on the line as well.

If our medical front line goes down, the whole country is at risk. The president must immediately and forcefully use the Defense Production Act to direct manufacturers to produce all of the personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other medical supplies that we need to get through this crisis. Unbelievably, in the U.S. right now, doctors and nurses are unnecessarily putting their lives on the line treating people suffering from the coronavirus because they lack personal protective equipment like masks, gloves, and surgical gowns.

That is unacceptable. Emergency funding for any industry must come with the condition that workers keep their jobs and receive a living wage. I am proud to stand alongside @32BJSEIU in the fight to ensure that workers don't bear the cost of this crisis. https://t.co/z9iHj6UXRJ Suspend evictions, foreclosures, and utility shut-offs nationwide.

I will be outlining a proposal to address this crisis. Together, we will get through this. https://t.co/ZAqfgyzVNy Tonight, via national livestream, I will outline a proposal that addresses this horrific situation. https://t.co/Ti0jQraokJ In this unprecedented moment in modern world history, amidst massive fear and anxiety, I will do all that I can to insist that the Democratic response to this crisis be as bold as this moment requires. 

Now is the time to stand with the working families of this county. Not surprisingly, the Republican plan for the coronavirus pandemic is totally inadequate. 

It benefits the rich and large corporations, creates desperation for poor and working families and goes nowhere near far enough to address the health and economic crises we're facing. Uninsured Americans not only have to worry about getting sick from the coronavirus.

They have to worry about whether getting health care would bankrupt them.

During an international crisis or not, health care must always be a right. The People's Dialer 📞

With fear, confusion, &amp; uncertainty taking up more space in our lives, sometimes the most revolutionary thing we can do is care for one-another

https://t.co/TKul0jEjN9 Tonight, I will be holding a virtual roundtable on the economic and health crises created by the coronavirus outbreak. Tune in at 7 p.m. ET at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/p01FifNN0s Right now 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured.

Our profit-driven health care system is a danger to our people.

During this crisis, Medicare should cover all health care treatment for free, including coronavirus testing, treatment, and the eventual vaccine. https://t.co/ldCzfbl9Km We are the richest country in the history of the world. Every worker deserves a living wage, paid leave, health care, and a union—at all times, not just during a national crisis. Now is the time for us to stand together. Split a contribution between five charities that are fighting for kids, the economically disadvantaged, and workers during the pandemic: https://t.co/mJGDh6gbz4 More than 45 million Americans struggle with $1.6 trillion in student debt.

We must cancel all student loan payments for the duration of this emergency.

Long-term, we must cancel all student debt and make public colleges, universities, and trade schools tuition- and debt-free. Our current health care system does not have the doctors and nurses we currently need. During this crisis, we need to mobilize medical residents, retired medical professionals, and other medical personnel to help us deal with this crisis. 🚨 If you live in New York &amp; have an employer, you are now eligible for paid sick leave.

If you are a gig/contract worker: PLEASE CALL YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS.

Ask them what they’re supporting to take care of you. If they don’t hear it, they may not know it’s a district concern. https://t.co/kZ8Dopl2v9 We need to make certain that everybody in our country who needs to go to a doctor can get health care they need regardless of their income. In this crisis we must empower Medicare to cover all medical bills during this emergency. Our #MutualAid training is kicking off NOW and we’ll be using the hashtag #WeGotOurBlock to live tweet!

There IS a call cap and we are RSVP’d to be overbooked, so hop on ASAP to get on the call.

If you can’t make it, we’ll be sending you a recording along with our resource kit. https://t.co/05x4HNdARV We are likely already in a recession.

Workers are losing income while their bills pile up.

We need to provide direct, emergency $2,000 cash payments to every person in America every month for the duration of the crisis. We will get through this difficult time by looking out for one another and protecting the vulnerable. What is something someone has done to help you, or what have you done to reach out to others? I proudly stood with @PennaNurses and @District1199C to fight the closure of Hahnemann. We must re-open such hospitals and fund the creation of new facilities to address this pandemic. I hope that other cities and states will follow Philadelphia's lead. https://t.co/jhnJO8nH0m It's been estimated that the unemployment rate could hit 20% if we don't act boldly. A one or two time check isn't good enough—the government must tell every small and mid-sized business owner that we'll cover 100% of their payroll if they don't lay off anyone during this crisis. The crisis we face from coronavirus is on the scale of a major war.

https://t.co/vo5oU09v5t We must waive all student loan payments for the duration of this emergency. Join me live as we discuss the government response to the coronavirus and the actions required going forward. https://t.co/BRCjeg5TNw I'll be giving remarks tonight at 7:15 p.m. ET on how we can respond to the growing coronavirus crisis in a way that protects working people and our most vulnerable. Watch live at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. We need to provide emergency unemployment assistance to anyone who loses their job through no fault of their own. https://t.co/QuDYFJqQwq The workers of this nation must be taken care of during this crisis. I stand with @UNITEHERE workers urging the billionaire owners in @MLB, @NBA and @NHL to pay workers their full wages. #PayArenaWorkers https://t.co/RcybqYEKAp This must be a moment in which people ask fundamental questions about the rationality of our current health care system, which exists to make corporations as much profit as possible, regardless of the consequences. If you have questions about what is happening in your state, you can email us at info@berniesanders.com. https://t.co/2xRZHx107X As we continue to fight for universal health care and paid leave, it has never been more important to strengthen the trade union movement. Workers must have the right to collectively bargain for better pay, stronger benefits, and more power over their lives. While Arizona, Florida and Illinois are still voting today, going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and we respect whichever choice voters make. If you do go to the polls, please see CDC guidance on keeping yourself safe: https://t.co/dS8dW76GwH Join our digital rally live now: https://t.co/i4RcbGZ3vi Join me now for our first-ever digital rally featuring @Neilyoung and @dhlovelife, Jim James of @mymorningjacket, @freenationalsXX and many more special guests. https://t.co/hPh7H5OP2f Thank you to @nejbUNITEHERE. I will continue to fight alongside you and your 10,000 members across the Northeast for an economy that works for working people. https://t.co/DWFNsymm6T No one should go bankrupt due to medical bills.

No one should avoid a doctor because they can't afford it.

No one should watch a loved one die because they were uninsured.

We must end this injustice and pass Medicare for All. More than ever, America is in need of hope and vision. Our rallies have always been about uplifting the ideas that will heal this nation. That time is now. Please join us tonight in sharing that common purpose at our first-ever digital rally: https://t.co/859AJhsVbC

#NotMeUs https://t.co/2nFqRRhUn9 No one should ever be bankrupted because they got sick.

In the midst of this emergency, the U.S. government must be clear that everyone in our country must be able to get all of the health care they need without cost. Period. https://t.co/Ncy63qB8sU Welcome Jezebel blogger @BernieSanders, who promises he will fight for reproductive freedom as president https://t.co/NHxJAJyALn https://t.co/pwhwz6NFBF We have to make a choice. What kind of nation do we want to be?

Do we want to work together to tackle the problems facing this country, or be one where nothing fundamentally changes for the people with power who make huge amounts of money on greed and corruption? If you want to make real change and create an economy that works for all, you know what you need?

You need to take on Wall Street, the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the fossil fuel industry.

You don’t take campaign contributions from them. It is time ask the question of who owns the power in this country. #DemDebate https://t.co/CU9ptbXFDE We have the boldest plan to address the climate crisis and the courage to take on the fossil fuel industry. #DemDebate https://t.co/56Er0njNYx Coronavirus &amp; climate change demand similar responses:

"We tell the big money interests that this is not a time for profiteering, this is a time for all of us working together."
- @BernieSanders

People over profits. Health over profits. Our future over profits. https://t.co/N7i7OQkRGm On day one we'll restore the DACA program for the 1.8 million young people who are eligible. We will we end ICE raids and family separations.

We will have a humane, sensible immigration policy supported by the American people. #DemDebate I voted against the Defense of Marriage Act.

Biden voted for it.

I voted against the war in Iraq.

Biden voted for it.

I voted against NAFTA and PNTR.

Biden voted for them.

It takes courage sometimes to do the right thing. #DemDebate Go to the YouTube. Take a look at Joe Biden's record of trying to cut Social Security. #DemDebate https://t.co/JGlWBqwQpn In 1995, I was on the House floor fighting the GOP’s efforts to cut Social Security. 5 days later, Joe Biden gave a speech in the Senate bragging about his work with the GOP to try to freeze funding for Social Security. #DemDebate https://t.co/1mVkEpVv1Y Joe, be honest. You have tried to cut Social Security for 40 years. #DemDebate https://t.co/zRfEctAM60 What we have got to address is not just the current economic crisis, but also address the fragility of the economy, in which so few have so much and so many have so little. #DemDebate https://t.co/bqZ2rLChdj In 2008 when we had the Wall Street bailout, the people on top did very well. This time around, let us learn that lesson and pay attention to the working families of this country. #DemDebate This coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current health care system.

We are the only major country not to guarantee health care to all our people.

We need Medicare for All. #DemDebate https://t.co/ifuI79NoDu If I am president, we will make it clear that whether you are rich or poor you will get the care you need. The drug companies will not be allowed to rip off the American people. #DemDebate The first thing we need to do, whether I'm president or not, is to shut this president up and finally listen to the scientists. #DemDebate https://t.co/inqQm6sYNI The debate starts soon on CNN. Follow along with updates on our live blog here: https://t.co/gIAhoeOi4z Join @briebriejoy, @NaomiAKlein, @MattMcGorry, @MsLauraGomez and more as they preview the CNN debate at 8 PM ET. https://t.co/GEq9GSv12l No one should be in debt because they needed health care. We have got to cancel all $81 billion in existing past-due medical debt. I don't think there has ever been a more important debate. 

Urge friends and family to watch. If you aren't under the same roof, watch together on the phone and discuss (don't leave it to pundits to spin it for you.) 

A safe candidate is one committed to keeping everyone safe. https://t.co/2B8jDnjlBn It's great that Joe Biden is now supporting a position that was in the Democratic platform four years ago.

Now we must make all public universities, colleges and trade schools tuition-free for all, cancel all student debt, and fund it with a small tax on Wall Street speculation. https://t.co/DQiCPDsqs2 Thank you to @ShowUp4RJ for their tireless fight against racism, xenophobia, and white supremacy. I'm honored to receive their endorsement.

Together, we will continue the fight for racial justice and build a more just and equitable future for all. https://t.co/yILMa1QcTv Our country is facing a medical and economic crisis the likes of which we've not seen in generations.

Our response must meet the enormous scale of the pandemic.

Now is the time for solidarity, and robust action. https://t.co/B1Rq0FtGkt These are tough times. We will get through this. Never forget that we are all in this together. https://t.co/43VVG0IzwD Tonight, the American people will see Joe Biden and myself on a debate stage, one-on-one, debating the solutions to the enormous crises facing our country. I hope that you will tune in to CNN at 8 pm ET. https://t.co/l35ZZe5FWB If our neighbor or co-worker gets sick, we have the potential to get sick.

If our neighbors lose their jobs, then our local economies suffer, and we may lose our jobs.

It is at this moment that we must remember that we are all in this together. “Our country is facing a medical and economic crisis the likes of which we've not seen in generations…It is at this moment that we must remember that we are all in this together.“

Tonight, join me for a fireside chat from my home in Burlington to discuss our vision for the country. I’ll be taking questions from our audience. Tune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS at 7:30 p.m. ET. https://t.co/BKZyxLCBEN The pharmaceutical industry must be told in no uncertain terms that the medicines that they manufacture for this crisis will be sold at cost. This is not the time for profiteering or price gouging.
