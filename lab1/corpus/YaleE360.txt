 In the Bay Area, where the coronavirus is now eclipsing the dangers of drought and fire, the new pandemic is the starkest reminder yet of how connected we all are. To tackle both COVID-19 and climate change, there is no option but global collaboration. 

https://t.co/g1KNZXj1sE “If we cut down vast numbers of Tongass old-growth trees, especially at this critical time of climate change… we will help to condemn ourselves — and generations to come — to a destabilized, hothouse Earth.” Kim Heacox on Alaska's Tongass Nat'l Forest: https://t.co/icoqZervki Regenerative agriculture is good for soil health and has environmental benefits. Many people believe that soils may help capture carbon. But nearly all scientists want more certainty before fully endorsing fighting climate change using farming practices. https://t.co/qSfezZhaKz East Antarctica’s Denman Glacier has retreated nearly 3 miles over the past two decades, losing 268 billion tons of ice between 1979 and 2017, according to a new study. https://t.co/Ilko0DXFdL https://t.co/RgtcLAExUq The agriculture giant Monsanto and the German chemical giant BASF were aware for years that their plan to introduce a new agricultural seed and chemical system would probably damage many US farms, according to internal documents. @guardian reports: https://t.co/tCnOpOlCT4 One study suggests that nearly 4 million people in major cities of the tropical Andes use glacial melt as a basic water resource. Melting glaciers could exacerbate already-existing water shortages. https://t.co/1PWIHgCq66 New studies are raising questions about the climate impact of reducing tillage and how much carbon can actually be stored in cover crops. A massive ramp-up of data from working farms is urgently needed, experts say. Reported with the support of @FERNnews: https://t.co/qSfezZhaKz “No one worked on all of those successes. But someone worked on each of them, and that’s what made the difference.” @carlsafina writes about the importance of our actions in saving species: https://t.co/9Aq4zIotdr Scientists say they have discovered a type of methane-oxidizing bacteria living in upland Arctic soils that could potentially offset rapidly increasing methane emissions from thawing permafrost. https://t.co/f1ybQi6uCo There are concerted public relations campaigns by the plastic industry to undo plastic bag bans, citing that reusable bags can spread COVID-19. But no study has looked specifically at reusable bags and the novel coronavirus. @MotherJones reports: https://t.co/rqZud68H6w Stimulus packages created in response to COVID-19 have the potential to focus on large-scale investments in things like clean energy, battery storage, and carbon capture-and-storage technologies. https://t.co/W5oL7VUVxM https://t.co/NAAeWRRFa1 Markets are emerging to pay farmers to store carbon in the soil with improved agricultural practices.

But the most lasting lesson may be what the coronavirus teaches us about the urgency of taking swift action. https://t.co/JtgtoMsuYk In Brazil, President Bolsonaro’s administration in 2019 fired or didn’t replace 21 out of 27 environmental superintendents who tracked deforestation and issued fines, and its seizures of illegally harvested timber dropped to almost nothing. https://t.co/hROrRedzd4 https://t.co/qrC3yNMmz6 Clouds have long been the biggest uncertainty in climate calculations.

About a third of the total sea level rise comes from Greenland and Antarctic ice loss.

If the movement is denied street demonstrations for months, it may find its resources drying up and activists demoralized. https://t.co/8yQPFQI0Rz Just a few years after simultaneous bark beetle outbreaks decimated trees in the Rocky Mountains, scientists have found that large portions of these high-elevation forests are already showing signs of recovery, according to a new study. https://t.co/Mq8Q9kGK5x https://t.co/N0gLQoEIq6 Since 2010, fossil fuel companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects in the U.S., including expansions of existing facilities, new plants, and associated infrastructure such as pipelines. https://t.co/sDxYIuwSG9 Natural disasters such as floods, heatwaves, droughts, and storms currently cost $195 billion annually in direct expenses.

The group’s leaders were growing disappointed that the protests had not prodded governments to respond with far reaching climate measures. https://t.co/8yQPFQI0Rz The coming exodus of species in response to climate change will require a reevaluation of the traditional native-alien dichotomy that has governed conservation. https://t.co/srjWorWQNK East Antarctica’s Denman Glacier has retreated nearly 3 miles over the past two decades, losing 268 billion tons of ice between 1979 and 2017, according to a new study. The glacier holds enough water to raise global sea levels by about 5 feet. https://t.co/Ilko0DXFdL https://t.co/lh7kcMO4jx “This wasn’t just about going to college, I told them – this was about having a voice, about doing something about these injustices, such as unsafe drinking water and lead contamination. And they got it.” Thomas Easley writes: https://t.co/GD8rkvh7do “Beating the coronavirus is the first thing we have to do, but the fight to save the climate can’t stop… We know that political will, when it is there, can move mountains. We are experiencing this right now in the corona crisis.” https://t.co/8yQPFQZBJ7 Stimulus measures aimed at easing COVID-19’s economic shock could aim to drive emissions reductions too, by funding low-carbon infrastructure or offering online training for green-economy jobs to newly unemployed workers stuck at home. https://t.co/JtgtoMsuYk A new plan from the European Commission would push clothing manufacturers to better recycle and reuse textiles; require that all packaging be reusable or recyclable by 2030; and consider new guidelines on exporting waste from Europe. https://t.co/y7hDuBUCOV https://t.co/xJ9f6rnp1C Australian officials have confirmed that the Great Barrier Reef is experiencing “very widespread” coral bleaching — the reef’s third mass-bleaching event in five years. https://t.co/tDN6LwKKL4 https://t.co/pwqxAnkEM9 Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, Fridays for Future, was seeing numbers of protesters decline and its calls for action falling short of its goals.

Birds pant to cool off, exhaling air and water. The hotter they get, the more water they need to expel. The mourning dove, for example, requires 10-30% more water to keep cool than it did a century ago. https://t.co/3LIb7Jup2t The global response to COVID-19 will almost certainly bring a downward blip in carbon emissions. But such changes are likely to be temporary. If many grow fearful of public transportation, commuting’s carbon footprint might even rise further, experts say. https://t.co/JtgtoMsuYk On Wednesday night, the EPA officially opened the required 30-day comment period for its proposal to limit science that can be used in regulatory decisions.

From @nytclimate: https://t.co/1ksrCacDNi In the case of COVID-19, people and governments have mostly been far quicker to appreciate its danger.
