#HealthyAtHome #COVID19 https://t.co/rmrwMx4YvL "We must ensure that a prolonged disruption caused by #COVID19 does not result in rollbacks of the rights of people with autism." 

-- @antonioguterres on Thursday's #WorldAutismAwarenessDay. https://t.co/rDnouDdLq3 https://t.co/3ozf1xSvOT People with autism have a right to education and employment on an equal basis with others.

We must ensure that a long disruption caused by the #COVID19 crisis does not result in rollbacks of the rights they have worked so hard to advance. I had a productive call with @ashrafghani, 🇦🇫 President, on #COVID19's impact on health, social system and economy. I thanked him for leading an all-of-government approach with strong central coordination. @WHO stands ready to support 🇦🇫 to stop the #coronavirus. For months, African leaders have prepared for the arrival of #COVID19. Thank you, @PaulKagame, for discussing the importance early action at country level &amp; continental activation of coalition of political &amp; business leaders. United, to safeguard #Africa #coronavirus Very productive call with President @Macky_Sall of #Senegal. We discussed the impact of #COVID19 on African countries, including the potential disruption to daily life &amp; threats to food supply. We agreed all-of-government approach is key to tackle this issue. #coronavirus Much-loved children’s authors are joining #ReadTheWorld  initiative to read extracts of their books to millions of children and young people currently living in isolation amid the #COVID19 pandemic. https://t.co/tI00tZdj8P Today is #InternationalChildrensBookDay 📚!

Broad and expedited agreement on debt relief is essential to enable them to care for their people and avoid economic collapse. #Solidarity My appreciation to Prime Minister @narendramodi for announcing a $24 billion package to support 🇮🇳's vulnerable populations during #COVID19 crisis, including:
-free food rations for 800M disadvantaged people
-cash transfers to 204M poor women
-free cooking gas for 80M households. Countries are asking ppl to #stayhome &amp; shutting down population movement to limit #COVID19 transmission. These steps can have unintended consequences for the poorest &amp; most vulnerable. I call on countries to ensure these populations have food &amp; life essentials during the crisis.

As the pandemic evolves, so does the evidence, and so does our advice"-@DrTedros #COVID19 #coronavirus "In these circumstances, masks are only effective when combined with other protective measures.
WHO continues to gather all available evidence &amp; continues to evaluate the potential use of masks more broadly to control #COVID19 transmission at the community level"-@DrTedros "There’s an ongoing debate about the use of masks at the community level.

WHO’s priority is that frontline #healthworkers are able to access essential personal protective equipment, including medical masks and respirators"-@DrTedros #COVID19 #coronavirus "As of this morning, more than 200 patients had been randomly assigned to one of the study arms. Each new patient who joins the trial gets us one step closer to knowing which drugs work"-@DrTedros #COVID19 #coronavirus "There has been an extraordinary response to our call for countries to join the Solidarity trial, which is comparing four drugs and drug combinations.

Monitor everyone’s health for symptoms 🌡️ of #coronavirus https://t.co/1WakiPqzds To ensure refugees and migrants have adequate access to national health services, States may need additional financial support. This is where the world’s financial institutions can play a leading role in making funds available. https://t.co/vDa4UnT4A2 #COVID19 Inclusion will help not only to protect the rights of refugees and migrants, but will also protect public health and stem the global spread of #COVID19. https://t.co/vDa4UnT4A2 It's vital that everyone, including all migrants and refugees have equal access to health services and are included in national responses to #COVID19, including prevention, testing and treatment. https://t.co/vDa4UnT4A2 To avert a #COVID19 catastrophe, governments must do all they can to protect the rights and the health of everyone. Protecting the rights and the health of all people will in fact help control the spread of the #coronavirus. https://t.co/vDa4UnT4A2 #COVID19 can be controlled only if there is an inclusive approach which protects every individual’s rights to life &amp; health. Migrants and refugees are disproportionately vulnerable to exclusion, stigma and discrimination, particulary when undocumented. The situation for refugees &amp; migrants held in formal &amp; informal places of detention, in cramped &amp; unsanitary conditions, is particularly worrying. Considering the lethal consequences a #COVID19 outbreak would have, they should be released without delay. https://t.co/vDa4UnT4A2 3/4 of the 🌍’s refugees &amp; many migrants are hosted in developing regions where health systems are already overwhelmed &amp; under-capacitated, &amp; live in:
-overcrowded camps
-settlements
-make-shift shelters
-reception centers
where they lack access to health services, clean 🚰 &amp; 🚽. In the face of the #COVID19 crisis, we are all vulnerable. The #coronavirus has shown that it does not discriminate - but many refugees, those forcibly displaced, stateless persons and migrants are at greater risk. https://t.co/vDa4UnT4A2 .@UNHumanRights, @UNmigration , @Refugees and WHO: the health and rights of refugees, migrants and stateless persons must be protected in #COVID19 response 👇 https://t.co/vDa4UnT4A2 QU Dongyu, @FAODG, @WTODGAZEVEDO and I call on all countries to ensure that the response to #COVID19 does not unintentionally create unwarranted shortages of essential items &amp; exacerbate hunger and malnutrition. Here is our full statement: https://t.co/mNWaGWvVFJ I had a good call with @GotabayaR, President of #SriLanka, on #COVID19 today. We discussed health and economic impacts #COVID19 can have on his country and the whole region. I thanked him for mobilizing the whole-of-government in the fight against the #coronavirus.
