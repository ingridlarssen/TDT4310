 It was great to talk with ⁦@cmarinucci⁩. I’m not worried about yesterday’s battle, I’m focused on tomorrow’s battle. We must learn from this to prioritize preparedness going forward. https://t.co/i12sKadCDM Don’t forget you can get your Lulu and Whiskey shirt and help feed @ASASafterschool families: https://t.co/BdutrbZKUF @ilyanaLanai I did! @LisleDelisle I got her in December! She’s fantastic. Trying to teach Lulu social distancing. https://t.co/5k2sqpsIhh Arnold Schwarzenegger ( @schwarzenegger ) just donated $1,000,000 in masks and protective gear to hospital workers. https://t.co/fSlOYWLYM8 @attn If you are able, I really recommend giving a few dollars to help get more masks to our healthcare heroes: https://t.co/Q93K6yn2Ko It was great to talk with ⁦@cmarinucci⁩. I’m not worried about yesterday’s battle, I’m focused on tomorrow’s battle. We must learn from this to prioritize preparedness going forward. https://t.co/i12sKadCDM Think about donating to Frontline Responders Fund, which @Schwarzenegger has supported with $1 million donation -- GoFundMe effort  https://t.co/4LvF8OztgW to raise money for desperately needed equipment during the Covid-19 crisis. Stay at home, stay fit. We can’t control the virus, but we can control our fitness. https://t.co/CBrlrxRRpQ @HopealwaysRene @ASASafterschool Please tell him thank you. He is a hero, along with every trucker, grocery store worker, doctor, nurse, hospital employee and every single person keeping us healthy and keeping goods moving at this time. @PeterFManning3 @ASASafterschool Thank you! You can visit https://t.co/2Ze1pP4tk4 You’re too kind, it wasn’t a draw! Thanks for always giving back and teaching chess to kids. Because of your inspiration, chess is part of our after-school programs. Now we have youth chess at every @ArnoldSports festival around the world. I hope to catch up soon &amp; learn more! https://t.co/ZgwUTxZg4S Since you guys love Whiskey and Lulu so much, 100% of the proceeds from this shirt will go to @ASASafterschool, to help in our mission to provide food for the families we serve while schools are closed. Support us here: https://t.co/BdutrbZKUF https://t.co/oqzjsT6kTK Here’s your daily Lulu update - she’s not the best chess partner but she’s getting there. If you’ve been putting off something like learning chess with your family, use the time you’d normally be out and about. https://t.co/S3QoBJtO7q Here’s another great piece about our heroes: https://t.co/yXUN8Fzg13 Whiskey and Lulu need exercise too. https://t.co/PWVfHkv6B4 I promised to share good news about the heroes amongst us. Here’s another great piece about @sugarfish. https://t.co/QcHzhzdoWM I promised to share good news about the heroes amongst us. Here’s another great piece about @sugarfish. https://t.co/QcHzhzdoWM I’m going to take this as a compliment! Stay safe. https://t.co/N1bqhfTe4z Thank you for doing such a great job social distancing. Remember to get outside for walks and bike rides to get your exercise but keep your distance from others and stay safe. We will get through this together. https://t.co/KoqPcXku0b I’ll keep sending Whiskey and Lulu updates, and you send me your favorite stories of doctors, nurses, truck drivers, grocery store stockers, people who check in on the elderly - anyone who gives you hope. I’ll share in this thread throughout the crisis. Stay safe, stay at home. I read this story in @TexasMonthly today about @HEB and it is a masterclass in preparation and being ready to support your community. https://t.co/boIJ9UfvqC I know it can seem overwhelming and it can be easy to focus on the negative, so as I find them, I’m going to start sharing the stories of heroes who prepared, who stepped up to help their fellow Americans. They give me hope. This crisis is unprecedented, but we have gotten through disasters, from earthquakes &amp; wildfires to hurricanes &amp; tornadoes by using the 7 P’s: Proper Prior Planning Prevents Piss Poor Performance and by working together. Sitting at home in self-quarantine, @Schwarzenegger has been thinking about what it would be like to be in charge right now: 

“There are moments, and especially moments like this, where I feel like, 'Oh, that would be really great to be there now.'"  https://t.co/azPmyAv6lE The other day @Schwarzenegger recorded a Corona PSA from his hot tub. Then he got on a Zoom call with me to talk disaster preparedness, mini-donkeys and how close we are to The Terminator timeline now. https://t.co/azPmyAv6lE (plus, you can hear the conversation in podcast form) In times of uncertainty, @Schwarzenegger is our beacon of hope. A flickering light house in a storm. His words of comfort: "Instead of worrying about the things we can’t change, let’s focus on the things we do control."

Stay at home, stay fit: https://t.co/P2LrmL7QIM https://t.co/2D89LF5X4V I never believed in sitting on the couch and complaining about how bad things are, I always believed we should all do our part to make things better. This is a simple way to protect our real action heroes on the frontlines in our hospitals, and I’m proud to be part of it. https://t.co/F7s1dh0YFz Due to the current situation concerning the worldwide outbreak of the #coronavirus, the @climateAWS and the #ClimateKirtag are postponed to September 17, 2020. Arnold @Schwarzenegger: “Stay healthy and listen to the experts. I am looking forward to seeing you all in September!" https://t.co/opn2WF9IRB @dog_rates Does Lulu qualify? https://t.co/2rmQ8fBnzm Here’s your no-gym workout that only requires a broomstick and some chairs: https://t.co/CR8zQxJvvI https://t.co/kJV2sM1UUt After my home workout, fueling up  with Whiskey and Lulu. https://t.co/keXGJye6MK Thank you @tiktok_us and @Schwarzenegger for your generous partnership!

This is a big win, but TikTok and ASAS cannot do it alone. Please consider joining #TeamAllStars today to give instant relief to our students and families across the nation: https://t.co/zsdBELjg8B https://t.co/T1X4VutJBl There are a lot of things we can’t control during this crisis, so we need to focus on what we can control. I wrote up my old no-gym required workout for all of you, as promised, because we can control our fitness. https://t.co/cL0gSMgf1o Remember to thank the heroes who are serving so selflessly right now - from doctors &amp; nurses to grocery store staff and delivery people. I play an action hero in the movies - they are the real action heroes. https://t.co/GkXpdLOrJs There are a lot of things we can’t control during this crisis, so we need to focus on what we can control. I wrote up my old no-gym required workout for all of you, as promised, because we can control our fitness. https://t.co/cL0gSMgf1o TikTok teamed up with @ASASafterschool, an organization founded by @Schwarzenegger to help families whose children are missing out on meals that they depend on due to the school closings caused by the coronavirus pandemic. https://t.co/RQORwA0ZPq we've teamed up with @Schwarzenegger &amp; @ASASafterschool

I play an action hero in the movies - they are the real action heroes. https://t.co/GkXpdLOrJs A crisis requires improvisation. With schools closed, @ASASafterschool can’t provide our 100,000 kids with after-school programs, but we can still support them. Thanks to my friends @tiktok_us for this incredible $3M donation to feed our families. https://t.co/ips1FOM5lJ https://t.co/jL1gNQ2O5I I know it’s not easy being home, but we all have to get along. Be like Lulu, not Cherry. Use this time to spread kindness, check in on your family and friends, and of course, no biting. https://t.co/7DfhmYz3lo Stay. At. Home. That means you, too, spring breakers. https://t.co/jUOgjLaOGN Doctors say that riding my bike outside is OK so it’s the only way I’m leaving the house, but if you do ride your bike or go for a walk, don’t stop, avoid social contact. Apologies to everyone but I won’t be stopping on my rides for selfies. Stay positive, stay safe. https://t.co/WAb4h57VAZ #newprofilepic #staytheFhome https://t.co/YFKQmz5WZr Stay at home as much as possible. Listen to the experts, ignore the morons (foreheads). We will get through this together. https://t.co/FRg41QehuB @DrTedros @deepikapadukone @priyankachopra @CTurlington Here you go @DrTedros! https://t.co/RT2RJzIaUi https://t.co/Ksyk5qjSWp I tried to do a hand-washing tutorial for Cherry but I think you guys will pay more attention. Be safe. Wash your hands. Listen to scientists and experts, not foreheads. Together, we can slow this down and protect each other. #COVID19 https://t.co/evDxVu6Etb Always remember that beating yourself up takes energy you could be using on actions to build yourself up and make you feel better instead of using that energy to tear yourself down. https://t.co/43kCRzPNtq I was proud to join my friends @JohnKasich and @JohnKerry for our first @WorldWarZeroOrg townhall in Columbus. The only way we can terminate pollution is Republicans and Democrats working together. There isn’t Republican air or Democratic air. It’s time to unite &amp; protect health. https://t.co/rqBu3nuY7e We're LIVE in Ohio with @JohnKasich, @JohnKerry, @Schwarzenegger, and @EAlexTheGreat for our first #WorldWarZero town hall conversation about the #ClimateCrisis with Ohio students and residents.

Tune in for our livestream TODAY at 2:30 p.m. ET.🔽 https://t.co/TJReBBpxB2 #WorldWarZero #ActOnClimate You are an inspiration and a champion! https://t.co/S8QsMAlnEd It was my honor to give @TripleH our @ArnoldSports lifetime achievement award! Thank you for decades of kicking ass and giving back! https://t.co/NdmaV0ws8R And finally, congratulations to our winners of the Best Poser Trophy, and the Inaugural Franco Columbu Most Muscular Trophy, Sergio Oliva Jr and Big Ramy! https://t.co/sIuRPZuTUu Congrats to William Bonac, our Arnold Classic champion! https://t.co/PjFjfWXrxa Congrats to our Bikini champion, Isa Pecini! https://t.co/sP69SuSvXN Congratulations to Thor Bjornsson, our Strongman champion! https://t.co/aIudGR6Ssr Tonight’s @ArnoldSports final is dedicated to my friend Franco Columbu. Tune in at the link below: https://t.co/8qbm7sakX3 I’m really sorry that our fans can’t watch our sports. But the state said that parents can watch their kids. We have decided that any parent or guardian shouldn’t have to pay. No tickets required. https://t.co/JU9g3Vc1Gt The state has ordered that only the Friday and Saturday night bodybuilding and strongman shows can have attendees. The general public can’t watch sports. Parents of minors can. I will see everyone at 7pm Friday and Saturday. Here was the letter @Schwarzenegger sent to @GovMikeDeWine and @MayorGinther yesterday. https://t.co/yuifDEeLKr Since there are questions: all sports will continue, and I am looking forward to seeing the athletes compete. I’ll be keeping everyone updated on proper precautions throughout the weekend. It’s a sad day for me and everyone at the @ArnoldSports team. But we will always put our fans’ health first. After discussions with @GovMikeDeWine, @MayorGinther, and the CDC, we will be postponing the expo because we can’t risk bringing 250,000 people together with #COVID19. https://t.co/Fuzcmapxiy I can't wait to be back in Columbus, Ohio next week for the Arnold Sports Festival with 250,000 of my closest friends. 85 different sports, 22,000 athletes, 80 nations. Our fitness crusade gets bigger and bigger every year. https://t.co/wEKN508wAd The constitutional amendment (SJ 18) backed by @1VA2021 would:

✅ assure VA voters a constitutionally guaranteed role in redistricting
✅ stop partisan gerrymandering
✅ protect voting rights
✅ prevent mid-decade redistricting  

SJ 18 deserves a fair vote on the House floor. https://t.co/uJmazR34jy @ilovejohnkimble Yes. Good eye! This time I brought LuLu too. https://t.co/4KLxA9eLV1 @SamWangPhD I like your style Professor! @VVforDelegate Thank you for working to terminate gerrymandering! This has been a passion of mine since my first attempt in 2005 in CA so I love when I see other good government reformers trying to make government work for the people. @breaddrink1 I have fought against gerrymandering in Democratic states and Republican states. The issue is not partisan for me. But to answer your question, the Democratic Party controls the VA legislature and Governor's office. All eyes are on Virginia, and I urge the General Assembly to support the amendment. I want to thank my friends from @1VA2021 for tirelessly fighting day after day to #terminategerrymandering. This amendment is the only way to truly prevent the legislature from rigging district lines in the future, and time is running out for lawmakers to act. Gerrymandering has always been a bipartisan problem, and it requires a bipartisan solution. I hope the General Assembly will support the amendment as they did in 2019. Virginia is at a crossroads, and the General Assembly is left with 2 options: a constitutional amendment with broad support, or an advisory commission that will not prevent the legislature from drawing their own district lines. This is an easy choice. https://t.co/KqohoeHuNm JUST ANNOUNCED — @JohnKasich, @JohnKerry, @Schwarzenegger, and @EAlexTheGreat are coming to @Otterbein University on Sunday, March 8th for a town hall conversation about the climate crisis.

https://t.co/G3OksHJx7R https://t.co/BFQf6BzhA1 The biggest misconception about homelessness is that it is an easy issue to just get rid off, but it's not that cut and dry. -- @Schwarzenegger https://t.co/zKMRNuvH7V Let me tell you a personal story about our homelessness crisis. We can fix this - if we put politics and selfishness aside and work together. https://t.co/BKgkdeL63A @realDonaldTrump We’ll all have to come together at the federal, state and local level, regardless of politics, to solve this issue. https://t.co/vd65KbbnyS Last year, 567,715 people in the US experienced homelessness.

Now it’s time for action https://t.co/gJVNs3h10f Thank you to @kdeleon, Assemblyman @SantiagoAD53, and my old buddy @HerbJWesson for brainstorming long-term solutions.

Thank you to Senator @HollyJMitchell, Supervisor @kathrynbarger, and Mayor @RobertGarciaLB for discussing short-term solutions to help bridge the gap for the Californians left behind. Thank you Mayor @ericgarcetti for your passion and your problem-solving. It was fantastic to hear from you and I look forward to working together with you more on this issue. Thank you Mayor @Kevin_Faulconer for sharing what has worked in San Diego and giving the audience hope that we can lick this problem. Thank you to @Mayor_Steinberg, my old friend, for speaking on two panels and explaining your policy proposals. You’ve always been a genius, and I always love working with you. Thank you to Professor @GaryDeanPainter for laying out the issues and explaining how many people are economically homeless and how we can fix our housing market. Thank you @GovernorDavis for joining us today. This isn’t a Republican or Democratic issue and we all have to work together to solve it. You’re a great friend and a champion.

"I just want to give back...&amp; use my star power to put the spotlight on issues that are very important."

More: https://t.co/p3LGzFuuE4 https://t.co/SdCRZ5XanP "It was a goal everyone said is impossible to fix...I think we can get there."

You have had such an incredible year and I am so proud of you. https://t.co/vqI8HTPcTw JUST POSTED: California finally reached 1 million solar roofs. @Schwarzenegger and @JerryBrownGov got together at a high school near Fresno today to celebrate.

Up next: 1 million batteries? https://t.co/LwAMbRm1oG Today was a fantastic celebration. But it is a wonderful reminder that we can do great things if we work together, don’t worry about ego or party, and think big. https://t.co/MmoFFOJvQ6 This is Troy. I met him today. He grew up in Bakersfield where he said the two job choices were agriculture or oil. He chose oil and worked his ass off drilling. But today he works in the solar industry, and he loves his job. I want everyone to hear his story. https://t.co/qsDeJCYWuV 3. If politicians are willing to pass big, visionary laws that they won’t be able to celebrate in time for their next campaign, we can do great things. Building a million solar roofs took 13 years. We are all out of office and can’t use it to win re-election. But the people win. 2. Consistency creates investment. CA has been on this path for decades, since Governor Reagan. We don’t give the voters whiplash by changing our environmental policies every administration. @JerryBrownGov continued the program after I was out of office. We stay on the path. Three quick lessons:
1. No success is self-made. Without Senator Kevin Murray, who wrote the bill, without the activists, without my great staff, and without the hardworking Californians who work in our booming solar industry, we wouldn’t be here. Proud to celebrate California’s million solar roofs today. This is an example of government working. We promised that 3 billion dollars would create 1 million roofs and 3,000 megawatts. And we got 1 million roofs and almost 9,000 megawatts. We under-promised &amp; over-delivered. https://t.co/UvTNjbK5lP .@Schwarzenegger celebrates CA’s 1 millionth solar roof.

He signed a bill as governor to make this day possible. 

“We should show the world they don’t have to come up with green *new* deal or anything new. They should just copy California...this is where the action is!” @FOXLA https://t.co/4KFvViVlYI Today was a fantastic celebration.

Proud to celebrate California’s million solar roofs today. This is an example of government working. We promised that 3 billion dollars would create 1 million roofs and 3,000 megawatts. And we got 1 million roofs and almost 9,000 megawatts. We under-promised &amp; over-delivered. https://t.co/UvTNjbK5lP A standing ovation for @Schwarzenegger as California places its 1 millionth solar roof. 

As Governor in 2006, he signed a bill that created this goal. 

It is becoming a reality at Buchanan High School in Clovis. https://t.co/ASHIxHopm0 In 2006, we set a goal to build a million solar roofs in California by 2019. With the help of a lot of hardworking Californians, we did it.

He said,  “America never ever in its history has said, ‘Let some other country do something first.’ We should lead,” he said.
